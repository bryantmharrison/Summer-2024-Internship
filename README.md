# Summer 2024 Internship
Quality Process Engineering Intern at the Michelin Corporation

### Daily Tasks
Shop Floor Tours
* Check around plant for various quality and safety items like cleanliness and welding cabinet locks
* Present Findings at N1 meeting - between operators and Business Unit Leaders (BULs)

Interface with Process Team
* Discuss findings on floor
* Determine important actions to forward to the N2 meeting - between BULs and shop manager

# **Hybrid Roller** - Main Project
Function
* Intended to replace cable rollers on the fixed and mobile calenders
  - Calenders use heat and pressure to stick rubber on and around rows of large metallic cable
* Designed to:
  1. Streamline cable paths shown below (note the crosses between notches on the rollers)

  2. Create more efficient use of rollers
  3. Mitigate wear on disk rollers and bearings
  4. **Make better product through these changes**

### Fixed Calender Rollers
Design Process
1. Initial Idea
   * Calender machine specialist explained the need for a roller that has large discs that spin in tandem with smaller edge disks that spin individually
   * Started project by investigating current rollers on the fixed calender
   * Recreated this roller in **SolidWorks** then began the modification of the design

2. Modification of Model
   * Removed ends of the solid roller

   * Began disk roller assembly

![Modified solid roller stage two](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db187829-31ad-42ff-9947-cd872dd9d574)
   * Completed assembly

![Modified solid roller stage three](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/190d7d57-3258-46ab-9f73-523657cfe44e)

3. SolidWorks Drawing
  * Drawing was created representing the new roller
  * It was submitted to the site engineering team for evaluation
  * Revisions were made and the following drawing was sent to made ready for manufacturing

4. Disk Size Setback
![Demonstration of disk size issues](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1262814-2107-405e-8f58-a66ae9c39f61)
   * It was discovered that the Michelin drawings called out 9-millimeter (mm) disks, when 11mm disks were needed
   * Rescinded the drawing from being able to be sent to a manufacturer
   * Began to rework the drawing

5. Finalization
   * Completed drawing and interfaced once more with engineering team

   * Approved and sent to manufacturer to obtain quoting for design

### Mobile Calender Rollers
1. Initial Idea
   * A different design to the fixed calender would be necessary
   * Rollers on mobile calenders do not rotate
   * Also, there is a center divider between the two halves of the rollers

2. Design
   * Settled on a sleeve-roller system

![Sleeve roller model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2670603-1236-434a-9c81-0789417d7735)

   * Reduces number of bearings from 44 per side to 15 per side
     * Decreases bearing strain
     * Less repairs necessary
   * Designed to slot into spots for current rollers on the two mobile calenders
   * Went through the same modeling, drawing, and quoting process as the rollers for the fixed calender

### Ordering
* Scheduled meeting to begin financial process
* Started official project statement with the on-site project manager
* Provided estimate for money needed
* Began tracking percentage of cable quality to help track benefits of the project
