# Summer 2024 Internship
Quality Process Engineering Intern at the Michelin Corporation

This Michelin internship a wonderful experience that allowed me to meet professionals in engineering and engineering-related fields. I built connections with the peronnel on site and the other interns based in the same areas. I learned about the tire manufacturing process and the role of my plant in the production of large earthmover tires (up to 77 inches in diameter!). This involved working closely with new machines and machine operators throughout the summer from May-August of 2024.

### Daily Tasks
Shop Floor Tours
* Check around plant for various quality and safety items like cleanliness and welding cabinet locks
* Present Findings at N1 meeting - between operators and Business Unit Leaders (BULs)

Interface with Process Team
* Discuss findings on floor
* Determine important actions to forward to the N2 meeting - between BULs and shop manager

# **Hybrid Roller** - Main Project
Function
* Intended to replace cable rollers on the fixed and mobile calenders
  - Calenders use heat and pressure to stick rubber on and around rows of large metallic cable
* Designed to:
  1. Streamline cable paths shown below (note the crosses between notches on the rollers)

  3. Create more efficient use of rollers
  4. Mitigate wear on disk rollers and bearings
  5. **Make better product through these changes**

### Fixed Calender Rollers
Design Process
1. Initial Idea
   * Calender machine specialist explained the need for a roller that has large discs that spin in tandem with smaller edge disks that spin individually
   * Started project by investigating current rollers on the fixed calender
   * Recreated this roller in **SolidWorks** then began the modification of the design

2. Modification of Model
   * Removed ends of the solid roller

![Modified solid roller stage one](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92ae907a-0354-4d79-b38e-5c36286b49a5)

   * Began disk roller assembly

![Modified solid roller stage two](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db187829-31ad-42ff-9947-cd872dd9d574)

   * Completed assembly

![Modified solid roller stage three](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/190d7d57-3258-46ab-9f73-523657cfe44e)

3. SolidWorks Drawing
  * Drawing was created representing the new roller
  * It was submitted to the site engineering team for evaluation
  * Revisions were made and the following drawing was sent to made ready for manufacturing

4. Disk Size Setback

![Demonstration of disk size issues](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1262814-2107-405e-8f58-a66ae9c39f61)
   * It was discovered that the Michelin drawings called out 9-millimeter (mm) disks, when 11mm disks were needed
   * Rescinded the drawing from being able to be sent to a manufacturer
   * Began to rework the drawing

6. Finalization
   * Completed drawing and interfaced once more with engineering team

![Final drawing of hybrid rollers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afcdfca5-c858-43ec-b2fe-45a71682bf14)

   * Approved and sent to manufacturer to obtain quoting for design

### Mobile Calender Rollers
1. Initial Idea
   * A different design to the fixed calender would be necessary
   * Rollers on mobile calenders do not rotate
   * Also, there is a center divider between the two halves of the rollers

![Mobile calender rollers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31363beb-2c32-4358-9b3e-7b95d4236902)

2. Design
   * Settled on a sleeve-roller system

![Sleeve roller model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2670603-1236-434a-9c81-0789417d7735)

   * Reduces number of bearings from 44 per side to 15 per side
     * Decreases bearing strain
     * Less repairs necessary
   * Designed to slot into spots for current rollers on the two mobile calenders
   * Went through the same modeling, drawing, and quoting process as the rollers for the fixed calender

### Ordering
* Scheduled meeting to begin financial process
* Started official project statement with the on-site project manager
* Provided estimate for money needed
* Began tracking percentage of cable quality to help track benefits of the project

![Cable path analysis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de657818-8aad-417f-9ba3-d753c202da56)

**The hybrid rollers have just begun to be installed. We hope to see noticeable impact as the rollers are put in place over the next few months. We predict that the rollers will save 20 man-hours of time set aside for adjusting cable paths each week. All-in-all, the project cost the company about $200,000.**

## Commercial Items - Side Projects
Cable Bobbin Cart
* Operators need a cart to carry non-conforming cable spindles (called bobbins) to the designated non-conform area
* Ones in place had worn down
* Found possible commercial solutions and created a presentation to gather ideas from operators in the N1
* Settled on a wire tree
* Sent to personnel manager for ordering

Welder Magnet
* Welders used on cables are often not cleaned
* Some operators suggested the adoption of magnetic tools to clean the welders
* Found a commercial magnetic wand with extension capabilities and ability to turn on/off
* Sent to personnel manager for ordering

![Metallic chip collector wand](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/045326a6-6add-41e4-9beb-6c52c15cd801)

**This item was ordered and received, but other similar items were put in place. The change was noticeable immediately, as the welders were significantly cleaner within days.**

Tension Meter
* Currently, machine specialists would use a fish scale to tug on cables in the machine to check tension
* Decided to research tension meters to find a solution
* Found many types of tension meters similar to ones used before (now antiquated)
* Manager decided none of these were fit for the issue
* Instead, we found and ordered a new digitized fish scale as a temporary upgrade

# Threading Diagram - Second Project
Purpose
* Diagram that traces materials and product through a machine
* Useful in administrative meetings for demonstration
* Simple diagram!

Program
* Considered many programs like Microsoft Visio or even SolidWorks's sketching feature
* Settled on the online **draw.io** program

![draw.io interface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13ff73ee-a412-4ee8-87ad-07f91a2ba27a)

Sketching
* Studied calenders while running
* Used data to sketch rougly-to-scale drawings of the machines

![Fixed calender sketch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b36964b-b719-4c30-8960-f9c1f1d19a1b)

Drafting
* Transferred drawing to draw.io
* Used a 1mm : 4mm scale

![Final fixed calender drawing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a63a836-9923-4eaa-8922-9030c1b2ec03)

The same process was used for the mobile calenders

![Mobile calender drawing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd8d9c59-89ac-47cb-848f-050fda088a7f)

**Drawings are intentioned to be hung in administrative offices. They have already been used in email correspondences with alignment companies to determine which rollers on the fixed calender needed to be adjusted upon the next machine maintenance period.**
